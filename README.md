# Expert Advice on How to Build a Successful Career in Data Science, Including Tips on Education, Skills and Job Searching
## What is Data Science?
This is the scientific study of data.it is an interdisciplinary field that uses algorithms, procedures, and processes to examine large amounts of data in order to uncover hidden patterns, generate insights, and direct decision making. Data scientists use advanced [machine learning algorithms](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning-algorithms) to sort through, organize, and learn from structured and unstructured data to create prediction models.
## Who is a Data Scientist?
Data scientist are among the most recent analytical data professionals who have the technical ability to handle complicated issues as well as the desire to investigate what questions need to be answered. They are a mix of mathematicians, Computer Scientists, Statisticians, trend forecasters and others. They are in high demand and well paid because they work in both the business and IT sectors. Some of the roles of a data scientist are
* Data cleaning and preparation.
* Data exploration and analysis.
* Find patterns and trends in datasets to uncover insights.
* Create forecasting algorithms and data models.
* Training testing and validating models to ensure they perform well.
* Use machine learning techniques to improve the quality of data.
* Utilizing big data technologies.
* Communicate recommendations to other teams and senior staff.
* Deploy data tools such as python, SQL and R
* Deploy models into production environment to provide real time predictions
* Stay on top of innovations in data science field.

## Data Scientist VS Data Analyst
The work of a data scientist and data analyst can seem similar. Both find trends or patterns in data to reveal new ways for organizations to make better decisions about operations. But data scientists tend to have more responsibility and are generally considered more senior than data analyst.

Data scientists are often expected to form their own questions about the data, while data analysts might support teams that already have set goals in mind. A data scientist might also spend more time developing models, using machine learning, or incorporating advanced programming to find and analyze data.

## How to become a data scientist
### 1. Earn a data science or related degree.
Though it s not always required, employers generally like to see some academic credentials to ensure you have the know how to tackle a data science job. That said, a related bachelor's degree can certainly help. Try studying data science, statistics or computer science to get a leg up in the field.

### 2. Sharpen relevant skills
Here are some of the skills you'll want to have under your belt.
* **Programming Languages** - Proficiency in programming languages is essential for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Popular programming languages for data science include:
    * Python
    * R
    * SQL 
    * SAS
* **Data Visualization** - This is the ability to transform data and findings into understandable and visually appealing formats. Popular visualization tools include:
    * Python Libraries(eg matplotlib, seaborn)
    * Tableau
    * Power BI
    * Excel
* **Machine Learning** - Understanding and applying machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning, to predict outcomes and uncover patterns in data.
* **Big Data** - Managing and analyzing large volumes of data with [big data technologies](https://www.coursera.org/articles/big-data-technologies#:~:text=Big%20data%20technologies%20are%20the,process%20huge%20volumes%20of%20data.), understanding the complexities and challenges of big data environments.
* **Communication** - Translating complex data findings into clear, concise, and actionable insights for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 3. Earn Certifications
Participating in boot camps, taking online courses are some of the great ways to earn data science and related roles certifications, This helps show your knowledge and expertise about your skills.

### 4. Internships and Entry-Level Data Science Job
Though there are many paths to becoming a data scientist, starting in a related entry-level job can be an excellent first step. Seek positions that work heavily with data such as data analyst, statistician, data engineer or business analyst. From there you you can gain experience and work up the ladder as you expand your knowledge and skills.

### 5. Follow and Engage with the Community
If you want to become a data scientist, you're going to need to keep up-to-date with fast paced industry. There is no better way to stay informed about developments in data science than by engaging with what can be often be a generous and dedicated community.

As well as social media sites such as linkedIn, X, Discord, and Reddit, there are all kinds of blogs and data science experts you can follow. Look for people who are interested in the same areas as you, reach out for advice and get involved with what's  going on.
### 6. Prepare for Data Science Interviews
With a few years of experience working with entry-level data science jobs, you might feel ready to move into data science. Data scientist positions can be highly technical, so you might encounter technical and behavioral questions. Anticipate both and practice by speaking your answers loud. Preparing on examples from your past work or academic experiences can help you appear confident and knowledgeable to interviewers.
